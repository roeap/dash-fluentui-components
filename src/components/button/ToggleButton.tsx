/**
 * A button triggers an action or event when activated.
 *
 * ### Layout
 *
 *  - For dialog boxes and panels, where people are moving through a sequence of screens,
 *    right-align buttons with the container.
 *  - For single-page forms and focused tasks, left-align buttons with the container.
 *  - Always place the primary button on the left, the secondary button just to the right of it.
 *  - Show only one primary button that inherits theme color at rest state. If there are more
 *    than two buttons with equal priority, all buttons should have neutral backgrounds.
 *  - Don't use a button to navigate to another place; use a link instead. The exception
 *    is in a wizard where "Back" and "Next" buttons may be used.
 *  - Don't place the default focus on a button that destroys data. Instead, place the
 *    default focus on the button that performs the "safe act" and retains the content
 *    (such as "Save") or cancels the action (such as "Cancel").
 *
 * ### Content
 *
 * - Use sentence-style capitalizationâ€”only capitalize the first word.
 * - Make sure it's clear what will happen when people interact with the button.
 *   Be concise; usually a single verb is best. Include a noun if there is any room
 *   for interpretation about what the verb means. For example, "Delete folder" or "Create account".
