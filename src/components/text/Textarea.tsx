 *
 * ### Do
 *
 * - Consider using Textarea with outline appearance. When the contrast ratio against
 *   the immediate surrounding color is less than 3:1, consider using outline styles
 *   which has a bottom border stroke. But please ensure the color of bottom border stroke
 *   has a sufficient contrast which is greater than 3 to 1 against the immediate surrounding.
 *
 * ### Don't
 *
 * - Donâ€™t place Textarea on a surface which doesn't have a sufficient contrast.
 *   The colors adjacent to the input should have a sufficient contrast. Particularly,
 *   the color of input with filled darker and lighter styles needs to provide greater
 *   than 3 to 1 contrast ratio against the immediate surrounding color to pass accessibility
 *   requirements.
